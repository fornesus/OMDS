    "<p>While there is much discussion on the impact that GenAI (generative AI) will have in the fields of data science and software engineering, one thing is certain, which is that the top skill of the future is problem solving, as has always been the case in the past.  Though problem solving has often been gatekept (still the case in many ways within corporate America), individuals are becoming empowered to identify, create and solve for an array of problems within their work scope, as a hobby, etc.  The real potential in the concept of the <em>AI revolution</em> lies in its capability to empower individuals to forge their own paths and increase the scope of our problem solving skills and overall creativity so long as we ensure that we understand the constraints of GenAI and understand the <em>value of ethics as it relates to GenAI</em>.</p>\n",

    "<h3>Programming Context</h3>\n",
    "<p>Python is a powerful programming language and acts as a sort of Swiss army knife for programmers in many of the same ways that JavaScript is known (by some) in the context of the web (they also happen to be my preferred programming languages).  What makes programming languages, like Python and JavaScript, so useful are the plethora of libraries that were created to make life easier for programmers, which can enable us to focus on the most important task: solving the problem at-hand.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, in this notebook (which uses Python), the first step will be to import two important Python libraries for web scraping: <b>bs4 (BeautifulSoup4)</b> and <b>requests</b></p>\n",
    "<h3>Import Details</h3>\n",
    "<p>The <b>BeautifulSoup4 library</b> is a Python library that can be used by the program to parse and scrape HTML/XML content.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"margin-left: 2em\">If you don't know what HTML is, HTML, or <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, is the programming language that browsers use to serve content to users via the internet.  On a regular webpage (and not a Python notebook), you can right-click and go to an option that either has (or contains similar text to) <b>View Page Source</b> as an option, and you will most likely see the HTML text that the server of the website has served to your browser.  Alternatively, you can right-click and choose an option that with the exact words (or has similar words to) <b>Inspect Element</b>, and you will see your browser's console where, in real time, you can explore the different intricacies of the different elements on the webpage.  If you would like to learn more, feel free to use Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, ChatGPT, or another generalized Gen AI tool, to learn more about what you can do in a browser's console.</p>\n",
    "<p>The <b>BeautifulSoup class</b> is how the program will instantiate this process of parsing HTML/XML content within a source, in this case, a webpage.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, importing the <b>requests</b> library enables the program to make <b>HTTP/1.1</b> requests using a simple API that abstracts the process, otherwise.</p>"

This is why good code and good GenAI prompts contain a task (keep this as simple as possible), context that adds more information about the task, and formatting that is clear and consistent.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Context makes stories a lot clearer than when you don't have them, right?

Thus, I had to rewrite my original prompt to specify that I wanted to \"scrape different elements in an HTML webpage\" and not just HTML tables.

    "<p>Now that we have the necessary libraries imported, we can finally get into writing the code itself.</p>\n",
    "<p>So I actually began writing the code by prompting Copilot to show me how to create a browser request, the code for which you can find in the \"browser_request\" function, as well as the \"body\" variable in the \"content\" function that is meant to store the output that I wanted from the program.</p>\n",
    "<p>That's when Copilot output that the different elements of the browser request were the following: headers for a browser, a response from the server of the website, a \"soup\" which is an instantiation of how the BeautifulSoup4 library parses the HTML content of a webpage, and a variable for the elements to scrape all of the HTML tags as indicated under my discretion.</p>\n",
    "<p>Now that I have indicated the HTML elements that I would like for the program to scrape for, I prompted Copilot to show me how to loop through this list of elements.</p>\n",
    "<p>The original variant of this program simply output all of the different indicated elements, and so the original loop was simply outputting these elements in the order that they came in the webpage.</p>\n",
    "<p>After some thought, I realized that grouping elements by div elements would make for a more readable output, and so I prompted Copilot to show me how to, first, loop only through div elements (I would later add section elements as well) and, two, loop through each division element's child elements which, along with the div_counter element and body container element, form the rest of the \"content\" function.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, I tested out the functionality by creating an introduction string that included the greeting, name, additional information, title of the website to explore, and the url of the website to explore.  I later refactored this string into the \"intro\" function that would take these different elements as arguments to output the necessary introductory content.  I used the same approach with the conclusion which is instantiated as the \"ending\" function, which takes only the title and url elements as arguments.</p>\n",
